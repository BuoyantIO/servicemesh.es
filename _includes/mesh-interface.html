  <h3> Service Mesh Interface </h3>
  <p>
    In the face of the vast variety of Service Mesh implementations, a group of companies, including Microsoft, Buoyant (developing Linkerd), and HashiCorp (developing Consul), joined forces to create a common standard for Service Mesh features. The result, the Service Mesh Interface specification, means to enable tools based on Service Mesh Features (such as Flagger for Canary Releasing automation) to be compatible with any Service Mesh rather than binding to a specific set of implementations. Service Mesh users also benefit from the ability to change their Service Mesh implementation without changing the configuration.

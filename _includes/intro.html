  <h3> What is a Service Mesh? </h3>
  <p>
    A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer that adds features to a network between services. 
    It allows to control traffic and gain insights throughout the system. 
    Observability, traffic shifting (for canary releasing), resiliency features (such as circuit breaking and retry/timeout) and 
    automatic mutual TLS can be configured once and enforced in a decentralized fashion. 
    In contrast to libraries, which are used for similar functionality, a service mesh does not require code changes. 
    Instead, it adds a layer of additional containers that implement the features reliably and agnostic to technology or programming language.

    <b>Without a Service Mesh</b>, each Microservice implements Business Logic and Cross Cutting Concerns (CCC) by itself. <br>
   <b>With a Service Mesh</b>, Cross Cutting Concers (CCC) like traffic metrics, routing, and encryption are moved ouf the Microservice and into a proxy. 
    Business Logic and Business Metrics stay in the Microservice. Incoming and outgoing requests are transparently routed through the proxys. 
    In addition to a layer of Proxys (Data Plane), a Service Mesh adds a so-called Control Plane. If distributes configuration updates to all proxys 
    and receives metrics collected by the proxys for further processing, e.g. by monitoring infrastructure such as Prometheus.

  <h3> Who needs a Service Mesh? </h3>
  <p>
    The value of a service mesh grows with the number of services an application consists of. 
    Logically, microservices architectures are the most common use cases for a service mesh. 
    However, the specific interaction might be more relevant in regards to how a service mesh can improve the control, reliability, security, and observability of the services. 
    Even a monolith could benefit from a service mesh and some concrete microservice applications might not.

  <h2 class="section-heading--primary"> How to choose a Service Mesh Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    The alternative to Service Meshes are libraries that are included with the microservices. They
    provide similar features but require changes to the code. So the first step to choosing a Service
    Mesh is to figure out whether a library would be enough.
    <br>
    <br>  
    While Service Meshes have no impact on the code, they change operations procedures and therefore there is a lock-in.
    So until the Service Mesh Interface is fully supported by all Implementations, adopting a Service Mesh Technology is a long term decision. 
    Therefore, the implementations should to be compared and tested carefully in advance.
    Choosing the most flexible Service Mesh with the most features seems logical at first. 
    But the contrary could be true, because features and flexibility is often paid with cognitive and technical complexity.
    <br>
    <br>  
    The goal of the evaluation is to figure out which features are important to you and how you benefit from them.
    As service meshes impact the latency and the load on the server, these disadvantages have to be measured, too.
    <br>
    <br>  
    We recommend to approach the decision like this:
    <ol>
        <li>As a team, identify the most important problems to be solved by the Service Mesh.</li>
        <li>Dicuss your requirements regarding simplicity/usability, performance and compatibility.</li>
        <li>Take a look at the table below and identify your top two or three based on your needs.</li>
        <li>Try the implementations by executing their respective tutorials (links below).</li>
        <li>You may discard one candidate if you started with three.</li>
        <li>Setup three identical test environments.</li>
        <li>In two, install your Service Mesh candidates and install your application in all three.</li>
        <li>Perform a load test in all three and measure request latency, CPU and memory consumption by using tools like <a href="https://locust.io" target="_blank">Locust</a> or <a href="https://https://fortio.org" target="_blank">Fortio</a>.</li>
        <li>Discuss the results and experiences.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2 class="section-heading--primary"> How to choose a Service Mesh Implementation</h2>
  <p>
    Until the Service Mesh Interface is fully supported by all Implementations, adopting a Service Mesh Technology is a long term decision. 
    Therefore, the implementations should to be compared and tested carefully in advance.
    Choosing the most flexible Service Mesh with the most features seems logical at first. 
    But the contrary could be true, because features and flexibility is often paid with cognitive and technical complexity.
    <br>
    <br>  
    We recommend to approach the decision like this:
    <ol>
        <li>As a team, identify the most important problems to be solved by the Service Mesh.</li>
        <li>Dicuss your requirements regarding simplicity/usability, performance and compatibility.</li>
        <li>Take a look at the table below and identify your top two or three based on your needs.</li>
        <li>Try the implementations by executing their respective tutorials (links below).</li>
        <li>You may discard one candidate if you started with three.</li>
        <li>Setup three identical test environments.</li>
        <li>In two, install your Service Mesh candidates and install your application in all three.</li>
        <li>Perform a load test in all three and measure request latency, CPU and memory consumption by using tools like <a href="https://locust.io" target="_blank">Locust</a> or <a href="https://https://fortio.org" target="_blank">Fortio</a>.</li>
        <li>Discuss the results and experiences.</li>
    </ol>
